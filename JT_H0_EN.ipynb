        "    A Notebook is made up of cells, that contain code, text, images or other elements. Cells can be run individually in any order.*\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cell types**\n",
        "\n",
        "    There are two types of cells: code cells and markdown cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Code cells: Contain code that can be run. Output of the cell is displayed directly beneath the cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Markdown-cells: Contains formatted text. Markdown is a markup language that allows including elements like text, headings and images in a plaintext format. Running a markdown cell displays its output in the cells place.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Running cells**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Run a cell: Select a cell and press Shift + Enter or click \"Run\" -button in the toolbar. This runs the selected cell and moves to the next.\n",

        "\n",
        "    Insert Cell: You can insert a new cell by selecting \"Insert Cell Below\" or \"Insert Cell Above\" from the \"Insert\" menu.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Although you can run cells in any order in Jupyter Notebook, it is important to keep in mind that the order in which cells are executed affects the behavior of the code. If the code inside a cell is not completely independent (i.e. it waits for another cell to initialize a variable or execute a specific piece of code), the cells must be executed in the correct order.\n",
